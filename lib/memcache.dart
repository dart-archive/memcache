/**
 * Access to a memcache service.
 *
 * The memcache service – referred to as simply 'memcache' below – provides a
 * shared cache organized as a map from keys to values where both keys and
 * values are binary values (i.e. list of bytes).
 * For each entry in the cache an expiry time can be set to ensure the item is
 * evicted from the cache after a given interval or at a specific point in time.
 * The cache has a limited size, so items can be evicted by the service at any
 * point in time, typically using a LRU-policy.
 *
 * The key value used in memcache is a binary value with a maximum length of
 * 250 bytes.
 *
 * The values stored in memcache are binary values. The maximum size for a
 * value depends on the configuration of the memcache service. The most common
 * default is 1M (one megabyte).
 *
 * In all cases where a key is passed it can be of type `List<int>` or of
 * type `String`. In the case of `List<int>` the key value is passed directly
 * to memcache. In the case of a `String` the key value is converted into
 * bytes by using the UTF-8 encoding. Note that when combining both types of
 * keys in an application a key of one type can alias a key of the other type.
 * E.g. the keys `[64]` and `'A'` are the same key.
 *
 * When the type `List<int>` is used note the values are bytes and each value
 * in the list must be in the range [0..255]. Using the class `Uint8List`
 * from `dart:typed_data` provides a compact and efficient represetation.
